We also search for Dark Matter as it interacts with highly sensitive detectors, such as in the proposed £300M XLZD experiment to be hosted at the STFC Boulby Laboratory in Yorkshire.\n\nIn particle physics, we collect sets of data (EBytes) and I am interested in the simulation of these experiments, and the data curation, management and processing.",

It is necessary to filter, process and store this data quickly.\n2 – Ensuring the data has a physical relevance. A pyrometer value is meaningless if it doesn’t help us. Working out what sensor values are “good” and what are likely to cause defects is not trivial.\n3 – Solving things in a cost effective manner.

Currently I am interested in studying Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks and Mixed Density Networks to provide predictions of charge particle energy deposits in the ATLAS particle detectors. I have in the past worked on usage of machine learning techniques to identify particle types on High Energy Physics Experiments, some of which are currently deployed as standard techniques used in the ATLAS data processing workflows.",

        "body": "<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Modern machine learning methods have driven significant advances in artificial intelligence, with notable examples coming from Deep Learning, enabling super-human performance in the game of Go and highly accurate prediction of protein folding e.g. AlphaFold. In this talk we look at deep learning from the perspective of Gaussian processes. Deep Gaussian processes extend the notion of deep learning to propagate uncertainty alongside function values. We&rsquo;ll explain why this is important and show some simple examples.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the speaker</strong>: Neil previously was Professor of machine learning here in Sheffield. He continued to develop applied probabilistic machine learning while director of machine learning at Amazon in Cambridge. Then, in 2019, Neil was appointed as the inaugural DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge.</p>\n\n<strong>Mini poster session</strong>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re working in the field of ML (in particular early careers, or PhD, MSc) we&#39;d be very happy to have your posters up before/after the talk.</p>\n\n<strong>Event program</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>16:30-17:00&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-talk drinks/food</li>\n\t<li>17:00-18:00&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk</li>\n\t<li>18:00-18:30&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinks/food following talk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To find out more about this event, <a href=\"mailto:m.t.smith@sheffield.ac.uk\">email</a> us.</p>",

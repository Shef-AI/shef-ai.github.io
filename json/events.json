Bayesian methods are known to be useful to make sense of data, to make better models and to interpret the predictions, especially in the presence of noise in either input data or inference data. With this N8 CIR event, we want to share current practices in using Bayesian methods across a wide range of disciplines and applications, so that this can provide cross-pollination and enrich our understanding of which methods might be applicable.</p>\n\n<p>Submit your 300 word abstract to <a href=\"mailto:enquiries@n8cir.org.uk\">enquiries@n8cir.org.uk</a> by the <strong>30th of September</strong>.

In this talk we look at deep learning from the perspective of Gaussian processes. Deep Gaussian processes extend the notion of deep learning to propagate uncertainty alongside function values. We&rsquo;ll explain why this is important and show some simple examples.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the speaker</strong>: Neil previously was Professor of machine learning here in Sheffield. He continued to develop applied probabilistic machine learning while director of machine learning at Amazon in Cambridge. Then, in 2019, Neil was appointed as the inaugural DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge.</p>\n\n<strong>Mini poster session</strong>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re working in the field of ML (in particular early careers, or PhD, MSc) we&#39;d be very happy to have your posters up before/after the talk.</p>\n\n<strong>Event program</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>16:30-17:00&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-talk drinks/food</li>\n\t<li>17:00-18:00&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk</li>\n\t<li>18:00-18:30&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinks/food following talk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To find out more about this event, <a href=\"mailto:m.t.smith@sheffield.ac.uk\">email</a> us.</p>",

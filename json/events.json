Firstly fully supervised methods require tedious expert annotations.\nSecondly, the AI trained on expert labels cannot surpass the standard of the expert and therefore AI performance degrades as the labels become noisy. We proposed an indirect way of training our AI models using a weakly supervised, multi-instance, multi-task learning paradigm that avoids detailed annotations.\nWith this indirect way of training our AI, we demonstrated that our learning paradigm can elucidate\ninstance-level features very well. This work also provides mathematical guarantees on some properties of our weakly supervised method.",

Few-shot learning is an area of research that aims to address this, by striving to build models that can learn new concepts rapidly in a more &quot;human-like&quot; way. While many influential few-shot learning methods were based on meta-learning, recent progress has been made by simpler transfer learning algorithms, and it has been suggested in fact that few-shot learning might be an emergent property of large-scale models. In this talk, I will give an overview of the evolution of few-shot learning methods and benchmarks from my point of view, and discuss the evolving role of meta-learning for this problem. I will discuss lessons learned from using larger and more diverse benchmarks for evaluation and trade-offs between different approaches, closing with a discussion about open questions.<br><br><strong>Bio</strong>: Eleni is a research scientist at Google DeepMind, based in London UK.

However, to be suitable for deployment in applications, we require learning-based algorithms that come with guarantees of reliability, robustness, and safety. \n\nThis talk will focus on the reliability of model-free policy search, addressing the question: when do such methods find optimal solutions, and when do they get trapped in poor local minima? Existing work has considered static policies; however, for dynamic policies that remember past observations - necessary for optimal decision making in many applications - these questions have hitherto remained unanswered. Focusing on the classic control-theoretic problem of output estimation, I will present the first model-free policy search algorithm for dynamic policies guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution. \n\nAlong the way, I’ll also describe my path toward working on this problem, highlighting some of my contributions to model-based approaches for safe and reliable control, including data-driven robust control, system identification, and trajectory optimization. I will offer my perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of model-free and model-based methods, as well as the ways in which they complement each other. ",

        "body": "Animals use afferent feedback to rapidly correct ongoing movements in\nthe presence of a perturbation. Repeated exposure to a predictable\nperturbation leads to behavioural adaptation that counteracts its\neffects. Primary motor cortex (M1) is intimately involved in both\nprocesses, integrating inputs from various sensorimotor brain regions\nto update the motor output. Here, we investigate whether\nfeedback-based motor control and motor adaptation may share a common\nimplementation in M1 circuits. We trained a recurrent neural network\nto control its own output through an error feedback signal, which\nallowed it to recover rapidly from external perturbations.\nImplementing a biologically plausible plasticity rule based on this\nsame feedback signal also enabled the network to learn to counteract\npersistent perturbations through a trial-by-trial process, in a manner\nthat reproduced several key aspects of human adaptation. Moreover, the\nresultant network activity changes were also present in neural\npopulation recordings from monkey M1. Online movement correction and\nlonger-term motor adaptation may thus share a common implementation in\nneural circuits.",

Towards a functional model of representation learning in visual cortices, we derive a brain plasticity model using self-supervised learning theory from AI. The resulting learning theory models learning in babies on at least two levels: at the cognitive level, self-supervision signals come from spontaneous gaze changes (saccades), and at the mechanistic level, all the terms required to compute the parameter gradients can be mapped with data-grounded mechanisms (the learning rule is layer-wise local and only requires pre-post activity, top-down dendritic input or global neuromodulator-like factor). Despite this realism, we demonstrate that this algorithm builds useful hierarchical representations in visual cortices by testing it on machine learning benchmarks. Going further, we will sketch how to extend this theory in other sensory pathways with time-varying inputs (like the auditory pathway) towards a general theory of brain plasticity inspired by AI theory.",

Bayesian methods are known to be useful to make sense of data, to make better models and to interpret the predictions, especially in the presence of noise in either input data or inference data. With this N8 CIR event, we want to share current practices in using Bayesian methods across a wide range of disciplines and applications, so that this can provide cross-pollination and enrich our understanding of which methods might be applicable.</p>\n\n<p>Submit your 300 word abstract to <a href=\"mailto:enquiries@n8cir.org.uk\">enquiries@n8cir.org.uk</a> by the <strong>30th of September</strong>. Successful presenters will be informed by mid-October.</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Call for Posters</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>Poster submissions are welcome on <strong>any aspect</strong> of Machine Learning, simply provide a poster title when you register.</p>\n\n<p>Registration is open now and can be found on the N8 CIR website - <a href=\"https://n8cir.org.uk/events/machine-learning-theme-launch/\" target=\"_blank\">https://n8cir.org.uk/events/machine-learning-theme-launch/</a></p>",

In this talk we look at deep learning from the perspective of Gaussian processes. Deep Gaussian processes extend the notion of deep learning to propagate uncertainty alongside function values. We&rsquo;ll explain why this is important and show some simple examples.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the speaker</strong>: Neil previously was Professor of machine learning here in Sheffield. He continued to develop applied probabilistic machine learning while director of machine learning at Amazon in Cambridge. Then, in 2019, Neil was appointed as the inaugural DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge.</p>\n\n<strong>Mini poster session</strong>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re working in the field of ML (in particular early careers, or PhD, MSc) we&#39;d be very happy to have your posters up before/after the talk.</p>\n\n<strong>Event program</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>16:30-17:00&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-talk drinks/food</li>\n\t<li>17:00-18:00&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk</li>\n\t<li>18:00-18:30&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinks/food following talk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To find out more about this event, <a href=\"mailto:m.t.smith@sheffield.ac.uk\">email</a> us.</p>",
